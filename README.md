# phase_based_thesis
Repository accompanying my thesis project.

`motionmag.py` is the only file that should be used. This uses `filters.py` and `video_utils.py`

`motionmag_caching.py` introduces the caching mechanism introduced in the thesis, but as described there, it doesn't work properly
`batch_index.py` is a helper function for indexing in `motionmag_caching.py`
